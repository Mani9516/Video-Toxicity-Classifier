# Video-Toxicity-Classifier
 I've immersed myself in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address a compelling multi-label classification problem using a real-world dataset.
Here's what I accomplished:

Objective:- Developed a system to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic video using advanced NLP methods.

Text Preprocessing:- Undertook extensive text preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering:- Applied TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical features.

Model Training:- Tested three classifiers: Naives Bayes, Random Forest, and LightGBM.

Performance Comparison:- Evaluated and compared the performance of all three models.

 Model Performance Analysis:

-Evaluated Models:- Compared Naives Bayes, Random Forest, and LightGBM using both Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF metrics.
 
- Best Results:-
 - BoW:- LightGBM achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.9559 and an F1-Score of 0.98.
 - TF-IDF:- LightGBM delivered an outstanding accuracy of 0.9573 and an F1-Score of 0.98.

Final Implementation:

After thorough analysis, the LightGBM model was chosen for its highly accurate and reliable predictions. 

This detailed comparison demonstrated LightGBM's exceptional capability for NLP tasks, making it my preferred choice for similar challenges. This experience has significantly improved my skills in NLP, model evaluation, and feature engineering. I'm proud of this accomplishment and excited to take on more challenges in the future!
